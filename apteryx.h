/**
 * @file apteryx.h
 * API for configuration and state shared between Apteryx processes
 *
 * Stores data in a tree like structure with nodes referenced by
 * "paths" that have a file system-like format.
 *   i.e. /root/node1/node2/node3 = value
 *
 * Copyright 2014, Allied Telesis Labs New Zealand, Ltd
 *
 * API:
 *     SET - set the value for the specified path
 *     VALIDATE - accept / deny sets that match the specified path
 *     WATCH - watch for changes in the specified path
 *     GET - get the value stored at the specified path
 *     REFRESH - refresh the value stored at the specified path when required
 *     PROVIDE - provide the value stored at the specified path
 *     SEARCH - look for sub-paths that match the requested root path
 *     INDEX - provide search results for the specified root path
 *     PRUNE - from a requested root path, set values for all sub-paths to NULL
 *     PROXY - proxy gets and sets to the requested path via the specified URL
